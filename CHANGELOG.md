# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project intends to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once public interfaces begin to stabilize.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a C-oriented `.gitignore` covering prospective Meson and CMake build output, compiler artifacts, test output, and common editor files.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with the English-language policy, phase-gate rules, reference-script validation requirements, and commit-message convention.
- Added the GNU General Public License version 3, with the project designated as `GPL-3.0-or-later` in the README.
- Added this changelog using the Keep a Changelog structure.

### Changed

- Renamed the reference script installation target, lock file, work directory, log directory, and runtime identity from `sbo-auto` to `slack-update`, without changing the update workflow.
- Relocated the existing shell implementation to `tools/reference/slack-update-reference.sh` without changing its contents.
- Updated the roadmap to reflect the repository work completed in Phase 0.

### Development context

- Current roadmap phase: **Phase 1 — Stabilize and validate the shell reference**.
- Phase 0 is complete, committed as `3064cfa`, tagged as `planning-v1`, and published to GitHub.
- The first Phase 1 task is complete: runtime paths and identifiers now use `slack-update` instead of `sbo-auto` where appropriate.
- No function extraction, command-line parsing, `--check`, `--apply`, `--dry-run`, JSON output, configuration model, or stable exit-code work has been implemented yet.
- The next development task is to split the reference script into clearly named functions without changing its behavior.
- The reference script has not yet been validated against the Phase 1 acceptance matrix on a real Slackware-current installation.
